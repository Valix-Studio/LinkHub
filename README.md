# 🔗 LinkHub
An open-source, lightweight & easily configurable alternative to other platforms such as LinkTree & Solo.to. LinkHub allows you to have an unlimited number of links and makes it super simple to change colours.

##  ✍️ Configuring

 - You can edit the display name, image and links from the `config.js` file.
 - Colours can be edited from the top of the `styles.css` file.

## 📬 Deploying
As this is a static site composed of pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript, it can be hosted from a wide range of providers. I recommend using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) to host LinkHub. It's free, 24/7 uptime and has an intuitive management dashboard. As well as that, you can easily deploy to Netlify by clicking the button below.
